# Standard Library

Like any other languages, it needs a standard library so things don't get reinvented in order to do something useful.

## Operational semantics

Operational semantics defines the computational model of the programming language.

It also exports IR types, and should be used with the `a <=> b` trait.

## Number systems

This is where you'll find your numbers.

1. `Natural`,
2. `Integer`,
3. `Ratio a b`,
4. `Rational`,
5. `Real`,
6. `Complex`,
